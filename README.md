# Civic UnHackathon Guide

## Mission
The mission of a Civic UnHackathon is to develop citizens' ideas about a particular challenge into an actionable solutions without necessarily having coding knowledge or a technically working prototype. Rough, sketched, paper prototypes are highly encouraged.

This guide seeks to provide a framework for deliverables as well as tools to think through the solutions and their future implementations.

## Guidelines for the day
A Civic UnHackathon should be united around a particular theme from very broad to very specific (i.e. issues in Puerto Rico, education in Rhode Island, transit in San Francisco.) 
From there, the participants can pitch their own ideas within these issues that they'd like to 'UnHack' on or organizers can provide the opportunity to form into groups based on interests in subject areas within the theme space. (For example: in Puerto Rico interest categories could be Agriculture, connecting the diaspora with the island, social programs, etc.)


## Deliverables: 
Presentations can take the form of anything from sheets of paper to a simple powerpoint presentation but the aim should be to hit upon the following:

Be able to clearly articulate and demonstrate their idea
 + Pitch/Mission
 + Define audience
 + Be able to talk about process (how did you get to this idea?)
 + Some kind of visuals
 + basic UI flow
Future/Implementation Plan
 + What do you need to make this real? (what kind of data, resources)
 + Optional: define potential blockers (privacy laws, lack of data, programming man hours, etc.)
 + Optional: discuss potential business plan

##Prizes / Judging
A Civic UnHackathon should be inherently good-will driven, so the spirit of the event should not be competitive or motivated by the prizes, however here are some suggested criteria for the judges to determine a winner:
  + Perceived civic impact
  + Feasibility
   + technical feasibility
   + is the data out there?

##Resources:
 + Business Generation Canvas
 + UI elements kit
 + Judging Rubric
